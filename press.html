    	<h3 class="press-copy-header">Great Nations Eat Launches Unprecedente Billion Impression Media Campaign in 2015 to Transform the Conversation Around Hunger in America</h3>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p">WASHINGTON, D.C. (June 24, 2015) Today, Great Nations Eat launched an unprecedented media campaign to both raise awareness of the problem of hunger in America and to end it. Great Nations Eat will be featured on every major media platform, both nationally and locally.</p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p">The campaign is a five year committed partnership between national anti-hunger organization Share Our Strength, and the filmmakers behind the Participant Media documentary “A Place at the Table.”  Great Nations Eat seeks to build upon decades of advocacy from the broader anti-hunger movement.</p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p">“Hunger exists in every community and it affects the life of 1 in 6 Americans. That doesn't happen in any other developed nation. It shouldn't happen here,” said Billy Shore, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Share Our Strength.  “Ending hunger is possible. It will take public awareness and political outreach to build the necessary national will. It will take nonprofits, corporations, media outlets and government, all working together with ordinary citizens.  That is Great Nations Eat.”</p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p">Lori Silverbush, filmmaker and co-creator of “A Place at the Table” commented, “In 1968, the CBS documentary ‘Hunger in America’ transformed the national conversation about hunger, and we all but eradicated it by the late 1970s. But we’ve moved backwards, to epic levels of hunger and food insecurity in America.  So now it is our turn:  Great nations are capable of great acts. We have an unprecedented level of media engagement, now we need the powerful voices of Americans crying out for change.” </p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p">"If the hunger problem in America was just about more charity, it would have been solved already," added Tom Colicchio, Chef and Executive Producer of “A Place at the Table.”  “If you look at the public health issues this nation has solved before like yellow fever and cholera-- these are issues that we thought were just crises of the poor, issues of the inner city. As a great nation we made it a priority to end them, and we did. Hunger affects one in six Americans …if you’re on a crowded subway in New York, most likely there are people that are hungry sitting next to you; they’re in your community, you may know them.”</p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p"> “The media landscape today looks very different than it did in 1968. People consume their news in 40-character bites and 30-second chunks. People also want to play a hands-on, interactive role with the things they see and read,” said Tim Castree, Co-Founder of Great Nations Eat and long-time executive in the advertising industry.  “Great Nations Eat will leverage modern media to galvanize audiences and create mass movement by combing the power of scale with technology and platforms to help us make our case to the American public for action on hunger.”</p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p">Great Nations Eat will be featured on every major media platform, both nationally and locally, calling on Americans to “unite to fight hunger.” </p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p">See below for a snapshot of the campaign's scope. All of this work will result in a billion impressions across various platforms over six months. If each of those individuals took turns saying the word “hunger” it would take 31 years, 251 days, 7 hours, 46 minutes, and 39 seconds:</p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p">All of the advertising for the Great Nations Eat launch was created by the award-winning creative agency, BBH (Bartle Bogle Hegarty) New York. As the goal of the campaign was first and foremost awareness, the creative allows for the facts to evoke the emotion. The campaign PSAs use an unconventional approach to contrast the problem of hunger in America versus other countries, surprising viewers with the facts. Samples of the creative, including a recording of today’s call, can be found at GreatNationsEat.org/Press.  The full website GreatNationsEat.org will be available when the creative goes live on Monday, June 29th.   </p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p">The campaign website was created by Seattle’s digital creative agency, 8ninths. The site will provide users with unique “hunger experiences” that highlight the stories of who is hungry in America and why. </p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p">Sgt. Erik Hanno and his wife Stacy embody the struggle with hunger in America today. Sgt. Hanno is an active-duty infantryman from Colorado who served in Afghanistan and is currently taking courses in criminal justice. His wife Stacy is in nursing school and works hard to take care of their two young daughters, Kaylie and Teagan, while Erik is overseas. Despite there being two working parents in the family, the Hannos have to rely on WIC benefits to provide sufficient food for their family.</p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p">Jahnique lives in Detroit with her mother and older sister. Her mom, Marquel, is a single mother also working her way through nursing school. In spite of working 50 hours per week at two nursing assistant jobs, Marquel’s two daughters would be hungry without the free breakfast and lunch programs at their school. As Marquel works toward her degree, she must rely on summer meals programs and SNAP to provide three meals a day for her family.</p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p">The launch of this campaign is made possible thanks to the generous support of a group of individuals, corporate and foundation partners who recognized early on the impact their investment could make on the lives of millions of Americans.</p></div>
    	<div class="landing-copy-container"><p class="landing-p"><p>About Share Our Strength</p>

A Place at the Table is a documentary produced by Participant Media and Magnolia Films.  It tells the powerful stories of three Americans who maintain their dignity even as they struggle just to eat.
